        "   - **P1 (Critical)**: Immediate life threat (e.g., cardiac arrest, severe trauma, unconsciousness).\n"
        "   - **P2 (Urgent)**: Serious but stable (e.g., chest pain, breathing difficulty).\n"
        "   - **P3 (Standard)**: Non-life-threatening (e.g., minor injuries).\n"
        "2. Assign required resources (e.g., 'ambulance with defibrillator', 'paramedics', 'fire truck').\n"
        "3. Provide pre-arrival instructions (e.g., 'Perform CPR', 'Apply pressure to wound', 'Loosen tight clothing'). "
        "Only suggest actions the caller can safely do.\n"
        "4. If P1, escalate immediately—do not wait for more data.\n"
        "5. Use conservative judgment: Err on the side of higher priority if data is incomplete.\n"
